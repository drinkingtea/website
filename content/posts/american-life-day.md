Fortuitously, I read these words in the early hours of June 24, 2022, just
before I went to sleep.
With no mind to the looming Dobbs decision that would come only a few hours
later, I was struck by the initiative taken by Mordecai to institute a new
holiday among God's people.
The time of Esther and Mordecai was, much like our own time, a time in which
God did not speak to his people through prophets with new revelation.
There is no command from God to institute a feast, and Christians today are
certainly under no obligation to recognize Mordecai's feast of Purim or any
other, but he sets an example of remembering the help of our God.
We are free to have no feasts. We are also free to have them.

It should be our joy to continually celebrate what our God has done for us.
People make a point to remember the joy of birthdays and wedding anniversary,
but it is our custom.
It is far less often that people continually make a point to remember what God
has done for them.
God's answer to his people's prayers in the reformation of our court system and
the subsequent Dobbs decision should be in the memory of American Christians
for generations to come.
Those of us who lived under the rulings the dishonest Burger Court can delight
that God has restored justice.

As I considered my response on this passage though, something bothered me that
may also bother you.
The book of Esther is well know as a book that never actually refers to God,
either by name or title.
Is Mordecai celebrating the gift or the Giver?
One might almost conclude that Esther and Mordecai themselves were merely
children of Abraham in the flesh who had a merely secular affection for their
people.
But if we pay attention, we see that God is assumed by them, even when not
addressed.

Have a look at this excerpt from Esther 4:

> 13: Then Mordecai told them to reply to Esther, "Do not think to yourself
> that in the king's palace you will escape any more than all the other Jews.
>
> 14: For if you keep silent at this time, relief and deliverance will rise for
> the Jews from another place, but you and your father's house will perish. And
> who knows whether you have not come to the kingdom for such a time as this?"
>
> 15: Then Esther told them to reply to Mordecai,
>
> 16: "Go, gather all the Jews to be found in Susa, and hold a fast on my
> behalf, and do not eat or drink for three days, night or day. I and my young
> women will also fast as you do. Then I will go to the king, though it is
> against the law, and if I perish, I perish."
>
> 17: Mordecai then went away and did everything as Esther had ordered him.
>
> -Esther 4:13-17

To give context to this, Esther has been asked to put her life on the line by
unlawfully going before her husband, King Ahasuerus, to ask for help
for her people.
King Ahasuerus had already dismissed one wife at the beginning of the book of
Esther, so Esther's fear that he will react harshly is understandable.

Now, notice four things in this excerpt from Esther 4.
The first two come in verse 14.
Mordecai assumes that the Jews will be delivered, regardless of Esther, and
that calamity will befall Esther if she does nothing.
The hope and warning expressed here do not sound arbitrary, like someone
playing odds.
This sounds like a man who has a sure hope that justice will happen and Esther
has no real hope outside of it.
Third, notice Mordecai's concluding question to Esther, "And
who knows whether you have not come to the kingdom for such a time as this?"
Mordecai assumed there was a purpose behind Esther's circumstances.
He does not say it outright, but Mordecai seems to suspect that it was God who
orchestrated the high placement of Esther so he could use her in the saving of
his people.
The fourth thing to notice is Esther's response in verse 17.
Esther asks that Mordecai direct their people to fast on her behalf.
Abstaining from food would do nothing if God were not there to answer it as an
appeal to him.

The help of God's people came from God, not the machinations of man.
The help of God's people came from God, and they knew it.

Like in the days of Esther, our long sought after victory over the Roe decision
looked like a work of man, but we cannot deny the role of our God in this.

Remembering our own momentous occasion is a chance for us to praise God.
More than celebrating the end of an abridgment our murder laws, we celebrate
that our God heard us.
More than the gift, we celebrate the giver.
We celebrate because God has done something, that we may revel in his glory.
Our God is just and he will advance justice throughout the world.
Though the nations rage, they are ultimately his to do with as he pleases.

Also fortuitous for me, was the fact that I already happened to be going to
gathering of believers with plentiful food that evening.
We feasted. We sang. We prayed and thanked God for what he had done.

But, going back to the passage I opened with, there is another activity that we
did not imitate.
We are under no obligation to follow this tradition and it is not an intuitive
response for me, but in addition to feasting, they gave gifts to the poor.
It does not specify that the gifts were extravagant, but gifts of sincere
goodwill would certainly be a cause for the world to praise our Father who is
in heaven.
Benevolence born of joy testifies to the Fount of the joy.
